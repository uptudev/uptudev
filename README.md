# Hi, Iâ€™m uptu.

Iâ€™m interested in learning languages that take years off my lifespan.

Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and Zig after years of being a crusty Java and C# dev, as well as sharpening my scripting in JS/TypeScript and Python. I make Noita mods in Lua, and do game development in Rust using the Bevy framework. My website stack for [uptu.dev](https://uptu.dev/) can be found below.

I also learned how to quit Vim after a decade of using Eclipse, Visual Studio, and VS Code, so I may as well be a software engineer at this point ðŸ—¿. These days, I primarily use Neovim, but use IntelliJ when I need to do stuff with the JVM.

I have a kitten named Bean after Princess Tiabeanie from *Disenchantment*. She gets jealous of my keyboard.
