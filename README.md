Hi, Iâ€™m uptu.
- Iâ€™m interested in learning languages that take years off my lifespan.
- Iâ€™m currently learning C and C++ after years of being a crusty Java and C# dev, as well as sharpening my scripting in Python and JS/TypeScript.
- I also learned how to quit vim after a decade of using Eclipse and Visual Studio, so I may as well be a software engineer at this point ðŸ—¿.
