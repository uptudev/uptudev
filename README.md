Hi, Iâ€™m uptu.
- Iâ€™m interested in learning languages that take years off my lifespan.
- Iâ€™m currently learning C and C++ after years of being a crusty Java and C# dev, as well as sharpening my scripting in Python and JS/TypeScript.
- I also learned how to quit Vim after a decade of using Eclipse, Visual Studio, and VS Code, so I may as well be a software engineer at this point ðŸ—¿.

I have a kitten named Bean after Princess Tiabeanie from *Disenchantment*. She gets jealous of my keyboard.
