# Hi, Iâ€™m uptu.

I'm a passionate developer with over a decade of coding experience as a hobbyist. I have primarily worked with OOP languages such as Java and C# in the past, but have recently forayed into web development and systems programming, where I have taken to it quickly, thanks to my prior experience tinkering as a teen. My language of choice is now Rust, which I have been using for the last few months. Rust provides me with low-level control, clang-like LLVM compiling, WASM support, and the immensely useful borrow checker, making it a powerful language. I'm currently using Rust as my daily driver for developing games using the Bevy ECS framework, which provides me with just enough abstraction over raw OpenGL and WebGPU commands while still delivering a stripped-down, light and performant experience.

I am also a musician with 17 years of experience playing guitar, bass, and synths. I started playing guitar at 6, bass at somewhere around 10 years old, and keyboards/synthesis at around 12 years old. While I tend to produce music in the Drum n' Bass and Jungle genres, I have made projects for pretty much any genre under the sun. I enjoy listening to different genres depending on my mood, typically Jazz, Drum n' Bass, Metal, or Rap, although I also have playlists for Blues/Bluegrass/Folk, Ambient, and other genres I like; they're for more niche moods.

Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and Zig as well as sharpening my scripting in TypeScript, Lua, and Ruby. I make Noita mods in Lua, so it's become my favourite language to write quick scripts in.

I also learned how to quit Vim after a decade of using Eclipse, Visual Studio, and VS Code, so I may as well be a software engineer at this point ðŸ—¿. These days, I primarily use Neovim, but use IntelliJ when I need to do stuff with the JVM, as I can't be bothered to install Java and Kotlin manually when IntelliJ handles that for me.

I have a kitten named Bean after Princess Tiabeanie from *Disenchantment*. She gets jealous of my keyboard.
